This code suffers from a common but subtle PHP bug related to how it handles array keys and comparisons. Specifically, the loose comparison (`==`) in the `if` condition can lead to unexpected behavior. Consider this code:

```php
<?php
$myArray = array("1" => "one", 1 => "two");

if ("1" == key($myArray)) {
  echo "Key is 1 (string)";
} else {
  echo "Key is something else";
}
?>
```

Because PHP's loose comparison does type juggling, the string "1" is numerically equivalent to the integer 1.  `key($myArray)` initially returns "1", but the loose comparison causes the `if` condition to evaluate to true. This unexpected result occurs because the string key "1" gets compared numerically to the integer key 1, leading to unexpected behavior. 

This might appear to work in simple cases, but in more complex scenarios, it can easily lead to difficult-to-debug issues, especially when dealing with data from external sources where the data type might not be reliably consistent.
